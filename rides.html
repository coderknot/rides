              Space Mountain is the name of a space-themed indoor roller coaster attraction located at five of the Magic Kingdom-style Disney Parks (all except for Shanghai Disneyland Park). Although all five versions of the attraction are different in nature, all have a similar domed exterior façade that is a landmark for the respective park. The first Space Mountain ride opened in 1975 at Walt Disney World Resort in Florida, and similar attractions were then eventually built at the other Disney parks.

              The Incredible Hulk is a launched roller coaster located in the Islands of Adventure theme park at Universal Orlando Resort. As the name suggests, the ride is themed after comic book superhero character, the Hulk. The ride was positively received when it opened on May 28, 1999. It is the first Bolliger and Mabillard roller coaster to feature a launch design, primarily implemented by Universal Creative and MTS Systems Corporation. The launched lift hill accelerates the train to 40 mph (64 km/h) in approximately two seconds and reaches a top speed of 67 mph (108 km/h). Riders experience seven inversions throughout the course of the 3,700-foot-long (1,100 m) ride. The roller coaster temporarily closed on September 8, 2015, for a major refurbishment, reopening to the public on August 4, 2016.

              Millennium Force is a steel roller coaster built by Intamin at Cedar Point amusement park in Sandusky, Ohio, United States. It was the fourteenth roller coaster to be built at the park since Blue Streak opened in 1964. Upon completion in 2000, Millennium Force broke six world records and was the world's first Giga Coaster, a roller coaster that exceeds 300 feet (91 m) in height. It was not the tallest and fastest ride on earth when it opened: the Tower of Terror ll opened in 1997 at 377 feet tall and 100 mph and Superman: The Escape, opened in 1996, was 415 feet tall and 100 mph. The ride is also the third-longest roller coaster in North America after The Beast at Kings Island and Fury 325 at Carowinds. It was the first roller coaster to use a cable lift system rather than a traditional chain lift. The coaster has a 310 ft (94 m), 45-degree lift hill with a 300 ft (91 m) drop and features two tunnels, three overbanked turns, and four hills. It has a top speed of 93 mph (150 km/h).
